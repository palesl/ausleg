The goal of ausleg is to provide information on laws passed by the Australian Parliament since 1901. 

The functions: getPrincipalActs; getAmendingActs provide data up to November 2021. The data was scraped by myself from the [Federal Register of Legislation](https://www.legislation.gov.au)[^1] and is archived [here](https://www.github.com/palesl/Federal_Register_of_Legislation_Australia).

The functions: alrc_as_made; alrc_rels provide data up to April 2022. This data was scraped by the Australian Law Reform Centre[^2] in collaboration with the University of New South Wales and is stored on the [ALRC datahub website](https://www.alrc.gov.au/datahub/download-the-data/). These functions make use of the more comprehensive linkage data provided by the ALRC and should be preferred for those beginning new data projects.
