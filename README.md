Australian Parliament since 1901. This package provides data up to
November 2021. The data was scraped from the [Federal Register of
Legislation]().

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

## Use at own risk

I provide no warranty for errors either in the source material, or in my
data collection. This is my best attempt at faithful redistribution of
the material available on the Federal Register of Legislation. I would
be grateful for any
